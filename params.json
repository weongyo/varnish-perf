That is the reason why this is\r\n  including 'varnish' in its name.\r\n\r\n* But all socket operations are non-blocking.  One thread is enough to\r\n  handle several thousand concurrent connections.\r\n\r\n* For edge case testing, sometimes one thread isn't enough to hit the\r\n  top.  So multiple threads are supported.  Even more one centralized\r\n  statistics.\r\n\r\n* Little bit flexible syntax to define each URL entries.\r\n\r\n### Supported OS\r\n\r\n* linux\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nSimplified BSD (2-clause) license\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n\r\n* Weongyo Jeong - weongyo@gmail.com","note":"Don't delete this file!
